NRF24 Test Rig
--------------
An Arduino sketch for the ATmega328P (aka Arduino Pro Mini) which allows
testing of nRF24 wireless transceiver modules while manipulating multiple
variables. You can read details of the motivation and hardware project plans
on my blog post:

It makes use of 3 libraries (2 written by me):
